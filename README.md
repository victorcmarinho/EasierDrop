## 🚀 Why Easier Drop?

**Ever felt the frustration of dragging a file only to realize the destination app is hidden behind three other windows?** 

Easier Drop is your native macOS productivity companion that ends the window-shuffling madness. It provides a **temporary shelf**—a floating zone where you can "stash" anything (files, images, text) from any app. Gather your pile, navigate freely, and drop everything at once when you're ready.

> **It's like a physical shelf for your digital workflow. Free, open-source, and natively fast.**
